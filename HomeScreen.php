						Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs. This project is concerned with developing a Pharmacy Management System that will be used for retail and wholesale pharmacies. The purpose of this project is to manage all data derived for a pharmacy to maintain their business through the system rather than recording their data manually which is more so for the business to maintain and to a vox loss. According to feasibility study of different pharmacies in cities recognized that most of them they recording their data manually through the book of accounts. This type of recording data makes them to incurred more loss and they are not able to determine if they incurred loss or not for those who have a large stock of medicine. There is a bit of discrepancy in items n the stock. It is so hard for them even to recognize their all customer records; they cannot have even their weekly, monthly, or yearly report easily because of recording manually.

						This Project is a try to resolve their problems as far as we can. Some features are still under developments. We are hoping to work in this project further more to make it ready for public use.
